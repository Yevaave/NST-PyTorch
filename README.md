# Neural Style Transfer with PyTorch

## Overview

This project implements the Neural Style Transfer algorithm using PyTorch, based on the work by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge. Neural Style Transfer allows you to transform an image by combining the content of one image with the artistic style of another.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

- Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yevaave/NST-PyTorch.git
   cd your-repository

### Project Structure

- neural_style_transfer.py: Main script for running the Neural Style Transfer.
- requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or want to improve the project, feel free to submit a pull request.

### Acknowledgments

- Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge for their work on Neural Style Transfer.
- Alexis Jacq, and Winston Herring for their work on Neural Transfer Using PyTorch
